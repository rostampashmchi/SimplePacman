# SimplePacman
This is a project for my AI course in university <br/>
This is a simple version of automated pacman game that constraints on AI algorithms espesially min-max algorithm<br/>
we want our rational agent win the game with an adversarial algorithm call minimax<br/>
## rule of game:
we have two ghost here <br/>
our packman agent move based on minimax algorithm and our ghosts move randomly<br/>
every movement of packman decrese one score from it's score and eating each dot increase the score 10 point <br/>
## input and output:
we build a board in our main function <br/>
in output we show the score of packman agent and packman position and ghost positions
